# Dunegon And Dragon
### Version : 1.3.5

### Explanation
 - This is my python final project which called DND , this is adaptation from Dungeon And Dragon boardgame

 ### How to install and run the project
- This project is pure python and you don`t need library to run it

### How to use project
- this project run in terminal and the only things that you need is a text editor and python.
- first you need to register your informations will save on users.txt and passwords.txt
-   then you need to login!

### How this game works ?
- you are a player in 10 x 10 map
    - there is a door , key , and dragon
- for opening the door you need key so first of all you need to find key
- if your position and dargon poistion getting equal your going to lose the game 
    - if you are near the dragon, dragon will chase you (by Euclidean distance)
        - if your distance from dragon is 2 square by 30% of chance it will chase you
        - if your distance from dragon is 1 square by 90% of chance it will chase
- if your position and door position getting equal and you don`t have a key you got a message that you find door but you do not have key
- and in the end if you have key and reach the door you can escape from dungeon and win the Game
